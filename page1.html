        <h1 id="d2">WHY IS IT ACTUALLY REQUIRED?</h1>
        <p id="d3"> Most communities are formed with a specific goal and aim but struggle to maintain continuity and sustainability over time. <BR>
            
            <BR>This often happens because the goals are centered around the founders or are short-term. Once those goals are fulfilled, the community loses its purpose, missing out on the opportunity to establish a long-term legacy and leverage compounding benefits, which could have led to greater stablishment of a future's next billion dollar community.<BR>
            
            <BR>This inefficiency in utilizing human time resources(ON THIS ONLY MANY COMPANIES EARNS BIG) is the most frustrating part. <BR>
            
            <BR>Take the YouTube community, for example. Their success lies in continuous diversification across fields, different approaches, and creating a network that fosters a win-win situation, continuing their legacy without interruption.<BR> 
            
            <BR>Both sides gain value, and there are dynamic opportunities for everyone. <BR>
            
            <BR>We also need such a community so our presence can be felt by those around us, inspiring them to dream of our place.
