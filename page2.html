        <h1 id="d2">HOW IT WORKS?</h1>
        <p id="d3"> Not taking the roundabout way, let's come straight to the point: we are a small team with very dynamic and innovative thoughts on different things we see. We always have an idea to act on (we have an idea for an alternative to compulsory attendance, too, and everything we see sparks an alternative or idea in our brain—don’t know why, but it is like that). We are building this community to launch all of these ongoing ideas and, in addition, create a win-win situation for all of us and our future juniors. Currently, we have three plans for you for the day. These will continuously change, and this dynamic nature and common interest will be the driving force and uniqueness of this community compared to others.<br>  


           <br>
            1.GETTING YOU TO THE LEVEL OF FINANCIAL LITRACY: This will help you become mature about the world and its workings. This is the base upon which we can further our growth. This starting point is crucial for understanding the world's most important aspects and, arguably, the most important thing in your life too, whether you choose to take a job in MAFANG, start your own business, or pursue any other path.<br>


            <br>
            2.SCHOLARSHIP FOR ALL: I’ve observed that many students in my batch lack detailed awareness about scholarships and often worry about their expenses. Many end up taking loans, which adds an extra burden. Even if you haven’t considered this before, let me assure you that numerous opportunities are available to cover your expenses. For example, I personally receive assistance and support from BPCL and FFE.<br>
            

            <br>
            3.BUILDING NETWORKS: This is another crucial aspect that you will come to understand over time this is the thing taht works in interships,placements and even big companies also come to a campus due to this . We are actively working on this, which is why I refer to it as a community with ongoing and diverse objectives.<br> 
            

            <br>
            4.PLATFORM FOR ANALYSING IDEA: We understand that many of you will become entrepreneurs. We support every student's innovative thoughts and ideas. This community also serves as an analysis hub for such ideas. You can analyze your ideas here and receive valuable insights and data. If your idea shows promise, we will help you develop it further and provide additional support to help you move forward.<br>
