        <p id="d3"> We have our three-pillar system not only in the community but also throughout our entire Dots environment. We all must safeguard these pillars, which are as follows:<BR>


            <BR>
            1.Common Interest: This is crucial for moving the community forward. Without a shared interest, nothing will be possible, making this pillar indispensable.<BR>


            <BR>
            2.Value of Thoughts: We always believe in valuing diverse ideas and thinking. Not everyone can think the same way, and this diversity is what propels our community forward.<BR>


            <BR>
            3.Strategy: We operate based on a framework that guides our strategies, all of which are logic-based. We will only implement strategies that have a positive impact on both sides.<BR>
